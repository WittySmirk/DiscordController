# DiscordController
A Discord Bot that can play games using go

# Dependencies
This code itself has dependencies
https://github.com/go-vgo/robotgo and https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo
So whatever dependencies they have, you need
You also need a discord bot (put its token in the code where it is needed) and the GO language itself

# Usage
This is mainly supposed to be edited yourself, it is not meant to be an actual module more an app (hence why the module leads to a dead link and not this repo)
The code itself is self-explanotory, just follow how I set the commands I want in main and write the wrapper functions for them in control

# Thank You and I hope you have fun with my bot!
